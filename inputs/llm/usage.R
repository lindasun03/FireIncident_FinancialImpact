#how to convert the data of TFS_Alarm_Time to the year number

#ChatGPT
#To convert the data in the TFS_Alarm_Time column to the year number in R, you can use the lubridate package, which is part of the tidyverse and is specifically designed for handling date and time data. The function year() from lubridate can extract the year part from a date-time object.

#Here's how you can do it:

#First, make sure you have lubridate installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using install.packages("lubridate").

#Read your dataset into R.

#Convert the TFS_Alarm_Time column into a Date-Time object, assuming it is in a standard format recognized by R. If it's in a different format, you might need to specify the format explicitly.

#Extract the year from this Date-Time object using the year() function from lubridate.

#Here is a sample code snippet:

#R
#Copy code
# Load the lubridate package
#library(lubridate)

# Assuming your dataset is loaded into a variable named 'data'
# data <- read.csv("path_to_your_dataset.csv")

# Convert 'TFS_Alarm_Time' to a Date-Time object and extract the year
#data$Year <- year(ymd_hms(data$TFS_Alarm_Time))

# Now 'data' has a new column 'Year' with the year extracted from 'TFS_Alarm_Time'
#If your TFS_Alarm_Time is not in a standard format recognized by ymd_hms(), you may need to use a different parsing function or provide a format string. For example, if your time is in the format "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss", ymd_hms() should work fine. If it's in a different format, you might need to use mdy_hms(), dmy_hms(), or another appropriate function based on the format.
